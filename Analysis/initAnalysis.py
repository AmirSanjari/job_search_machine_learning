def initAnalysis(dataFrame):
    """
    Separate the DataFrame into placed and not placed categories for analysis.

    This function splits the provided DataFrame into two subsets based on the 'placed' column:
    one where 'placed' is greater than 0 (placed) and one where 'placed' is less than 1 (not placed).
    It then extracts the target and feature data for both subsets.

    Args:
        dataFrame (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame containing the data to be analyzed.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing four elements:
            - targetPlaced (pd.Series): The target data (3rd column) for placed entries.
            - dataPlaced (pd.DataFrame): The feature data (columns 4 and beyond) for placed entries.
            - targetNotPlaced (pd.Series): The target data (3rd column) for not placed entries.
            - dataNotPlaced (pd.DataFrame): The feature data (columns 4 and beyond) for not placed entries.
